		<h3>Broccoli Cheese Casserole</h3>
		<p>My mom made this broccoli cheese casserole every Thanksgiving when I was little. We kids could never get enough! If you have children or have some coming to visit you as guests this Thanksgiving, I guarantee that they will eat (and enjoy) this veggie dish. It's also fabulous with a Christmas ham.</p>

			<li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
			<li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
